    An SQLite aggregation function that approximates energy over time.

    Usage
    -----

    First, you must install it on the connection objects in Python::

        import sqlite3
        conn = sqlite3.connect(...)
        EnergyAggregation.install(conn)

    Then subsequent SQL queries can use it::

        SELECT energy(power, timestamp) FROM measurements GROUP BY test_id
